This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## About this frontend

This repository contains the frontend for the JFT web project, built with Next.js (app router).
It provides the UI layout, global styles, and the main pages under the `app/` directory.
Use this project to develop and preview the client-side experience; API and backend logic live in a separate repository.

Quick notes:

- Run `npm run dev` to start the local dev server.
- Main entry: `app/page.tsx` and layout in `app/layout.tsx`.
- Static assets are in `public/`.

Contributions: make feature branches, write concise commits, and open PRs targeting the `main` branch.
